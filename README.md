SUPPLY CHAIN PLANNING FOR A GLASS MANUFACTURER 

If you want further information feel free to constact me on jitendra.kr.rathore@gmail.com


PROBLEM SUMMARY:
You are a consultant to the CEO of a Glass manufacturing company. The CEO wants to improve her supply chain network and you are tasked to leverage your background in operations research to help her build a better plan for next year.
The glass manufacturer currently serves 50 customers located across the US, each of which has demand for five different glass products.  The glass products are made at four different US plants. Currently, the company produces each product at one location only and serves each customer directly from the source plant. 
Unfortunately, there have been many complaints about the supply chain lately and the CEO would like to address them this year. The most common complaints with the current supply chain have been that (1) service to some distant customers has been unreliable and (2) rising gas prices have had a large impact on the balance sheet through transportation costs.
The CEO would like to better understand two potential changes to the supply chain which may ameliorate these concerns:
1.	In order to improve service, it has been proposed that warehouses be built in such a way that 80% of total demand aggregated over all products (in tons) is delivered to the customer from a facility (warehouse or producing plant) within 500 miles. The CEO would like to know how many warehouses this would require and what the impact on transportation costs would be.

2.	In order to save on transportation costs and improve service, it has been proposed that upgrades be made to production capabilities at one, some  or all of the plants.  Upgrading a given plant would allow that plant to produce all products, albeit with a setup time and cost for switching from one product to another.  The CEO would like to know what which plants should be upgraded and what set of products each upgraded plan should then produce to maximize annual cost savings. This can then inform the expected Return on Investment (ROI) of upgrading the plants.

You have been tasked with modelling these changes to help the CEO determine if she should go forward one or both strategies. In order to do this, you will need to use the model(s) to determine how the proposed changes to the supply chain would affect performance relative to the current state. In order to communicate your results and recommendations, you should prepare a presentation that you will give to the company leadership.  Include in your
